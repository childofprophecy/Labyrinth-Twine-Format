# Labyrinth-Twine-Format
The purpose of this piece is to have players have an interactive experience with a program that is mostly made up of text and links/passages. This project is that so players that have an experience with twine yet to experience it in a more basic level to get used to these systems when they might play more advanced twine games in the future. The aim of this game is to have a narrative that the player themselves drive forward as they themselves will have to make choices that will impact where they go next. The theme of the game is supposed to be mysterious so there will be a good number of puzzles to solve within this story. Additionally, since there is a loop in this piece, it is supposed to imply that the player will be stuck within the labyrinth forever until they go to the right direction. There will be a good number of trial and error when players play this interactive piece. All these aspects of the game will hopefully make the player feel like they are immersed and are interacting with the piece.
